# Colorado_Climate_Analysis
Trends in Colorado's precipitation and temperature from 1940 through 1923. 


Coloradoâ€™s geography is very diverse with mountain ranges, canyons, valleys, high plains, and desert. Geography can impact the weather and result in different areas in the state experiencing different weather trends (Bolinger et al., 2024). Therefore, the average maximum and minimum temperatures, total precipitation, and total snow accumulation were analyzed for two cities in Colorado, Grand Junction and Fort Collins between the years 1940 and 2023, (fig. 1). These cities are separated by the Rocky Mountains and are in different climate divisions. Grand Junction is in the Mesas and Valleys climate division in central western part of the state and Fort Collins is located just East of the Rocky Mountains in the Northern Front Range climate division Bolinger et al., 2024).
