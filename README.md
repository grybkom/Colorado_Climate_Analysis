# Colorado_Climate_Analysis
Trends in Colorado's precipitation and temperature from 1940 through 1923. 

**Background**

Colorado’s varied topography, including mountains, plains, valleys, and deserts, affects weather patterns and climate variability across the state (Bolinger et al., 2024). To explore these regional differences, this project analyzes long-term trends in temperature and precipitation for two Colorado cities, Fort Collins and Grand Junction from 1940 to 2023. These cities lie on opposite sides of the Rocky Mountains and belong to different climate divisions. Grand Junction is located in the Mesas and Valleys climate division in western Colorado, while Fort Collins is in the Northern Front Range division, east of the Rockies.

 **This project focuses on:**
 
-	Average maximum and minimum temperatures
-	Total precipitation
-	Total snow accumulation
